                        <h2>The Product</h2>
                        <p>It’s a web app that takes an XLSForm as input and produces an XML-compliant file as output by writing the document either into the File System (1) or directly to the Database (2).</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>The audience intended for this software is people in charge of creating XLSForm files (3).
                            The app leverages the File System Access API to read/write local files in real-time. Whenever the “Convert to XML” button is clicked, a prompt feedback is given on the result of the conversion. In case of any error encountered (4), the user can quickly fix it in the file and click on the button again (5), without the need to upload it again, making the process smooth.</p>

                        <h2>The Process</h2>
                        <p>A simplified version of Scrum was adopted to manage the software development process effectively in a solo setup. I acted in both the developer and Scrum master roles, planning the work ahead. My head of the department was my Product Owner (PO), and the Chief Architect acted as a stakeholder/technical advisor.</p>

                        <p>The project plan was spread into 12 weeks, with a 2-week length spring, having a total of 6 sprints. A Gantt chart has been designed to track the time spent on each main task.
                            During this time, I had a review with the PO and the technical advisor about the work done at each end of the sprint.</p>
